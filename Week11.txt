If i explain in simple matter, graph clustering is like finding friend groups in a 
huge social network. We look for nodes that are 'close friends'—meaning 
they have many connections with each other—and we separate them from other 
groups that they don't talk to as much. To do this, we basically look for 
the 'weak links' between communities and cut them to see the different 
clusters clearly. It is a very useful way to organize messy data, simplify 
complex networks, and understand how different parts of a system actually 
work together.
